					<h1><a href="/blog/svg-media-query.html">How an SVG Media Query Made my Client's Website a Little Leaner.</a></h1>
					<p class="date">May 25, 2016</date>
					<p>This isn't a huge success story, but I thought it was sufficiently spiffy to warrant a short post. Who knows? This short post may help you some day.</p>
					<p>Not too long ago, I developed a static site for <a href="http://weeklytimber.com" target="_blank">Weekly Timber &amp; Pulp</a>, a logging business in Central Wisconsin. The designer on the project whipped up some comps with two breakpoints: One for phones and tablets in portrait view, and another for tablets in landscape view and larger. The designer is a good friend of mine, and loves to throw me a curve ball every now and again. So he gave the site's logo a different treatment for each breakpoint.</p>

					<h1><a href="/blog/webp-images.html">Getting Cozy with WebP Images</a></h1>
					<p class="date">April 25, 2016</date>
					<p>We've all been there before: You're browsing a website that has a ton of huge and beautiful images of delicious food, or maybe that new gadget you've been eyeballing. These images <b><u>tug at your senses</u></b>, and for content authors, they're essential in moving people to do things.</p>
					<p>Except that these images are downright huge. Like really huge. On a doddering mobile connection, you can even see these images unfurl before you like a descending window shade. You're suddenly reminded of the bad old days of dial-up connections.</p>
