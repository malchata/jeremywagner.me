					<h1><a href="/blog/svg-media-query.html">How an SVG Media Query Made my Client's Website a Little Leaner.</a></h1>
					<p class="date">May 25, 2016</date>
					<p>This isn’t a huge success story, but I thought it was sufficiently spiffy to warrant a short post about an SVG media query that helped me to cut an unnecessary image from a client's website while still accommodating their design. Who knows? This short post may help you some day.</p>
					<p>Not too long ago, I developed a static site for <a href="http://weeklytimber.com" target="_blank">Weekly Timber &amp; Pulp</a>, a logging business in Central Wisconsin. The designer on the project whipped up some comps with two breakpoints: One for phones and tablets in portrait view, and another for tablets in landscape view and larger. The designer is a good friend of mine, and loves to throw me a curve ball every now and again. So he gave the site’s logo a different treatment for each breakpoint.</p>

					<p class="date">April 25, 2016</date>
					<p>We've all been there before: You're browsing a website that has a ton of huge and beautiful images of delicious food, or maybe that new gadget you've been eyeballing. These images tug at your senses, and for content authors, they're essential in moving people to do things.</p>
					<p>Except that these images are downright huge. Like really huge. On a doddering mobile connection, you can even see these images unfurl before you like a descending window shade. You're suddenly reminded of the bad old days of dial-up connections.</p>
